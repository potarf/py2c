#py2c#
###A simple i2c compatible library for python that just works.#

##Other libraries#
Other libraries like smbus or connect2wire feel the need to make the i2c interface more 'pythonic' or more 'intuitive.' But in their attempt to make the process simple for new users, they make an extremely simple protocol far too complicated.

##This library#
Should make it easy for someone who understands i2c to   simply use the library the way one would a C library, with no bullshit.
